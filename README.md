# URL-Shortener

Project was inspired by websites that shorten your URL like Bitly.com. Another reason for this project was to practice GUI modules in Python.

## How does it work?
Unlike Bitly and other websites, this is a GUI version where users are able to enter URL and outputs a short version of the URL.

## Resources
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (Any Python that's above 3.5 is good. I just prefer the latest version of Python)
* [PyQt5](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)      (Main module used for making GUI.)
* [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-using-qt-designer.html) (Interface tool to build your GUI)
